Missing features and support I would like:

WISH: Show queued items when re-entering a dir with queued items.

TODO: quick keys, navigation etc.

TODO: qmgr needs Copy, Edit and Delete added.

TODO: qmgr needs to display sites involved, and misc status.

BUG: engine.c encodes the callback in user_data, but we have
interleaving calls, to qlist and qgrab for example. This will lead to
cores. 

TODO: qlist has zero mouse support.

TODO: qmgr has little mouse support.

TODO: There needs to be a way to go from qlist to qmgr. Since going to 
      display (when idle) will potentially release the queue.

TODO: When queueing, it sets both Queued and Selected. It should OR.

TODO: There is no "STOP" queue processing feature.
