From a client's POV, when a session is lost, should we really
issue "DISCONNECT" for one kind, and "SESSIONFREE" for another? Both
means you have to ask for a new one?



Race condition. When you issue SESSIONNEW, there is an uncertain time
passing as FXP.One is connecting and authentication with the remote
server. Eventually the successful CONNECT message will come back.

... However, you can issue any other SID related command in between
those messages, and since the SID is "known" to the system, but
technically not handled over to the client (refering by guess work?)
the client can issue, and insert commands in the middle of the
authentication phase.

We need to stop additional commands from "seeing" the SID, until the
SID is actually ready.




dirlist needs error handling beyond just dropping the session.



When queue is idle, it should be possible to "grab" it, and its
sessions (if connected) for further work, and QADD.



if RETR fails, the state engine gets lost (waiting for idle forever).


You can still do many naughty things. Like during queue-processing you
can call commands like CWD, PROT, CCSN, SSCN, PASV, PORT, etc etc. We
need extra checks to stop user commands when they don't own it.


BUG: If a session is released during TLS/SSL negotiations, we might
free the session node, before we receive a TLS FAILED event, which
will access the released session structure.

TODO: dir_skipempty = NO. We don't create empty dirs at all at the
moment.

TODO: Handle crappy symlinks in drftpd etc.

BUG: You can issue DIRLIST while you are already in DIRLIST. This will
core.

BUG: QMOVE and QDEL does operations without sending QC. This will
leave other clients inconsistent.




QDEL and QADD (when using FID) should be able to take a list of items.


BUG: Sorting by date, files 6 months old, day before it changes to
year display format, are sorted as this year.. (Aug 31st, displayed on
Mar 1st).

TODO: EPSV support, EPRT?
